        <h2 class = "section-heading">Overview</h2>
        <p class = "page-text">In this project, I investigated the users using boba kiosks where people can self-order 
            their boba without going to the counter. I observed different users to determine what types 
            of people are using the kiosks and understand their overall experience using the kiosks. 
        </p>
        <p class = "page-text"> I also conducted user interviews to better understand these users and the context under 
            which they are acting. Using an empathy map, I then created user personas I used to inform a 
            storyboard of the user experience.</p>
    </div>

    <div class ="section">
        <h2 class = "section-heading">About the Interface</h2>
        <p class = "page-text">The boba kiosk presents an option for users to order their boba without 
            going to the counter. In theory, they can decrease the wait time if the store is busy, 
            lower the burden on workers, allow users to make sure their order is more accurate, 
            as well as provide a way for less social customers to avoid social interaction.             
        </p>
        <p class = "page-text"> The boba kiosk is a variation on a self checkout station, and is similar 
            to ordering anything online on your own devices. Unlike your own device however, its touch screen 
            and actions are limited to showing the menu and facilitating orders.

        <h2 class = "section-heading">Interview Questions & Key Insights</h2>
        <p class = "page-text"> I followed up my observations with user interviews with three different 
            customers. Users consisted of both first time and return users. Overall, users appreciated 
            the interface for its convenience  and visual appeal, but had some frustrations regarding 
            customization and the consistency of how menu items were listed. Below are some featured 
            questions and answers.

        <p class = "page-text">In conclusion, I found that despite users finding the boba self checkout 
            kiosk to be convenient and quick, users were not too likely to choose to use it unless lines were really long.
            I also found that most users customize their orders, and were frustrated by the kiosk because of this. 
            Finally, I found that while users have set preferences that they adhere to, many users like to try different drinks.
