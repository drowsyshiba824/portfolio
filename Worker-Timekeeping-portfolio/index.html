                    <p class="page-text">Band of Hands is an HR startup based in San Diego working to 
                        make employment easier for both small businesses and workers. 
                        It provides flexibility to companies and workers by being a 
                        single solution for onboarding, time, attendance, HR, and payroll. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="page-text"> Over the summer, Band of Hands was at a pivotal moment when 
                        they were finding more clients, onboarding more workers, and needed to expand 
                        product functionalities. One such functionality with increasing demand was a time-tracking
                         system for workers.

            <h3 class = "mt-5 mb-4">My Contributions</h3>
            <p class="page-text"> I worked with the entire team to understand the 
                product's goals and design a time-tracking user flow on the worker mobile app.

            <p class="page-text"> I advocated for user research, successfully conducted interviews, 
                and created high-fidelity mockups that I then communicated to developers resulting 
                in the implementation of my designs, and the beginning of a product expansion 
                that is still continuing now.

            <h2 class="section-heading">Reflections</h2>
            <p class="page-text">In many of my prior projects, I felt that I could be both a user 
                and designer. However, in designing for worker's timekeeping, especially for users 
                with multiple jobs, I had no prior knowledge of that experience and it was really 
                important to learn from the team and users in terms of what they needed and wanted 
                to see.  
            </p>
            <p class="page-text">I was also presented with the new challenge of being limited by 
                legal restrictions, as well as having to communicate my designs with the developers. 
                These challenges pushed me to grow as a designer and come up with solutions I 
                would not have immediately arrived at otherwise.  
            </p>
            <p class="page-text">Being able to see my designs implemented for the clocking in and 
                out on both dashboard and job details page has made this project even more rewarding, 
                and I've really appreciated the opportunity to work at Band of Hands!
